This repository contains C++ solutions for various Codeforces problems, organized by contest rounds and practice problems. After solving 300+ problems on LeetCode, I started my Codeforces journey and use this repo to stay consistent, track my growth, and share solutions.

- **Contests/**: Folders for each Codeforces contest round, with C++ solutions for individual problems.
- **Practice/**: C++ solutions to selected practice problems from Codeforces.
- **Notes/**: Reference materials, notes, and problem tracking files.

## How to Use

- Browse the `Contests` and `Practice` folders for solutions to specific problems.
- Each `.cpp` file is a standalone solution. Open, read, or modify as needed.
- Compile any solution using a C++ compiler. Example:
  ```sh
  g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall filename.cpp -o filename.exe
  ```
- Run with test input:
  ```sh
  ./solution < input.txt
  ```
